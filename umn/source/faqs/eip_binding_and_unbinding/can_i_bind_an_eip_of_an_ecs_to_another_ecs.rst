Can I Bind an EIP of an ECS to Another ECS?
===========================================

Yes.

You can unbind the EIP from the original ECS. For details, see :ref:`Unbinding an EIP from an ECS and Releasing the EIP <eip_0003>`.

Then, bind the EIP to the target ECS. For details, see :ref:`Assigning an EIP and Binding It to an ECS <eip_0002>`.
