What Is the EIP Assignment Policy?
==================================

By default, EIPs are assigned randomly.

If an EIP is released by mistake, the system will preferentially assign you an EIP that you have released in the last 24 hours.

If you want a specific EIP that you released more than 24 hours ago, see :ref:`How Do I Assign or Retrieve a Specific EIP? <faq_eip_0012>`

If you do not want an EIP that you have released, it is recommended that you buy another EIP first and then release the one that you do not need.
