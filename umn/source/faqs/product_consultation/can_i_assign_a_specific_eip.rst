Can I Assign a Specific EIP?
============================

By default, EIPs are assigned randomly. If you have released EIPs, the system preferentially assigns EIPs from the ones you released.

You can assign a specific EIP only by calling an API. For details, see section "Assigning an EIP" in the *Elastic IP API Reference*.
