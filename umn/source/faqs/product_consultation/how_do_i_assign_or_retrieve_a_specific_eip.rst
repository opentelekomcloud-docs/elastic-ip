How Do I Assign or Retrieve a Specific EIP?
===========================================

If you want to retrieve an EIP that you have released or assign a specific EIP, you can use APIs by setting the value of **ip_address** to the one that you want to assign. For details, see `Elastic IP API Reference <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/elastic-ip/api-ref/apis/eip/assigning_an_eip.html#eip-api-0001>`__.

.. note::

   -  If the EIP has been assigned to another user, you will fail to assign your required EIP.
   -  You cannot use the management console to assign a specific EIP.
