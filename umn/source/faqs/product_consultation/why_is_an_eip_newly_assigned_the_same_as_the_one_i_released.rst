Why Is an EIP Newly Assigned the Same as the One I Released?
============================================================

If you have released EIPs in a region, the system preferentially assigns EIPs from the ones you released in the last 24 hours.

If you do not want an EIP that you have released, assign an EIP first and then release the one that you do not want.

You can assign a specific EIP by calling APIs. For details, see `Elastic IP API Reference <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/elastic-ip/api-ref/apis/elastic_ip/assigning_an_eip.html#>`__.
