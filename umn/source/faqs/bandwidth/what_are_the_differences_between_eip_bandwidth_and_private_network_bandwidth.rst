What Are the Differences Between EIP Bandwidth and Private Network Bandwidth?
=============================================================================

EIP bandwidths are used by ECSs to access the Internet through EIPs.

Private bandwidth refers to the bandwidth used by ECSs in VPCs. The private bandwidth and maximum data transfer speed (in PPS) allowed for an ECS are determined based on ECS specifications.

For details, see `ECS Types <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/elastic-cloud-server/umn/service_overview/instances/ecs_types.html#en-us-topic-0035470096>`__.
