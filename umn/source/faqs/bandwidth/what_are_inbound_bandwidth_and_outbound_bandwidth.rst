What Are Inbound Bandwidth and Outbound Bandwidth?
==================================================

Inbound bandwidth is the bandwidth consumed when data is transferred from the Internet to the cloud. For example, when resources are downloaded from the Internet to ECSs, that consumes inbound bandwidth.

Outbound bandwidth is the bandwidth consumed when data is transferred from the cloud to the Internet. For example, when ECSs provide services accessible from the Internet and external users download resources from the ECSs, that consumes outbound bandwidth.
