What Bandwidth Types Are Available?
===================================

There are dedicated or shared bandwidths.

If an EIP is not added to a shared bandwidth, the EIP uses the dedicated bandwidth no matter how it is billed.

-  Dedicated bandwidths can be used by only one EIP.
-  Shared bandwidths can be used by multiple EIPs.
