What Is the Relationship Between Bandwidth and Upload/Download Rate?
====================================================================

The bandwidth is measured in bit/s, but the download rate is measured in byte/s.

1 byte = 8 bits, that is, download rate = bandwidth/8

Due to various issues such as computer performance, network device quality, resource usage, and network peak hours, if the bandwidth is 1 Mbit/s, the actual upload or download rate is generally lower than 125 kByte/s (1 Mbit/s = 1,000 Kbit/s, upload or download rate = 1,000/8 = 125 kByte/s).
