What Is Elastic IP?
===================

The Elastic IP (EIP) service enables your cloud resources to communicate with the Internet using static public IP addresses and scalable bandwidths. If a resource has an EIP bound, it can directly access the Internet. If a resource only has a private IP address, it cannot directly access the Internet. EIPs can be bound to or unbound from ECSs, BMSs, virtual IP addresses, NAT gateways, or load balancers.

Each EIP can be bound to only one cloud resource and they must be in the same region.
